# My Schedule
// Info
This repo just helps me plan a few things out so that I don't forget them. It also helps others see how my life works.

// Homework
I do homework at random times. I try to keep ~10:00 - 2:00 AM for homework.

// Projects
Just like everything else, I do projects whenever I have any extra time. My main focus right now is PCK Studio.

// VRChat
Some days are chosen at random for group instances. These are the best timings I can give.
Wed/Sat ~5:00 - ~10:30: VRChat moderation
Fri ~6:00 - ~9:00: VRChat movie night

// Game Dev
I'll be learning more C++/Unreal Engine 5 in the upcoming months. I plan on making my own game in a year or so.
